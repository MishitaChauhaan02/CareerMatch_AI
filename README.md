AI Resume–Job Matcher

An end-to-end AI application that evaluates resumes against job descriptions using semantic similarity, skill gap analysis, and LLM-based feedback to provide actionable improvement suggestions.
This project simulates how modern hiring platforms analyze resumes using NLP and AI.

Tech Stack :
- Python
- FastAPI — scalable backend API
- Streamlit — interactive frontend UI
- OpenAI API — AI feedback & suggestions
- Sentence Embeddings — semantic similarity
- NLP & Skill Matching

Features :
- Upload resumes in PDF format
- Provide custom job descriptions
- AI-based semantic similarity scoring
- Skill extraction and skill match percentage
- Identification of missing or weak skills
- AI-generated feedback with improvement suggestions
- FastAPI backend for efficient inference
- Streamlit UI for easy interaction

How It Works:
- User uploads a resume and provides a job description
- Resume and job description are converted into embeddings
- Semantic similarity and skill overlap are calculated
- An LLM generates personalized feedback and suggestions
- Results are displayed in a clean Streamlit interface
